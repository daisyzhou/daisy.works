Please, nobody look at this project!

Notes to self:

For now, made some changes to the casper theme and using that:

    git clone git@github.com:daisyzhou/hugo-theme-casper.git themes/casper
    cd themes/casper
    git checkout tweaks

to run locally:

    hugo server --theme=casper

to generate static files:

    hugo --theme=casper


Currently, the generated files are pushed to github pages: https://github.com/daisyzhou/daisyzhou.github.io
